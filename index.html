				<h3>Software Engineer — Kodowa, Inc.</h3>
				<p>Blog: <a href="http://incidentalcomplexity.com/">http://incidentalcomplexity.com/</a></p>
				<p>Built a programming language designed to bring the power of computation to everyone — not by making everyone a programmer but by finding a better way for us to interact with computers. On the surface, Eve is an environment a little like Excel that allows you to "program" simply by moving columns and rows around in tables. Under the covers it's a powerful database, a temporal logic language, and a flexible IDE that allows you to build anything from a simple website to complex algorithms.

				<div class="date">January 2015 - Present</div>
				<h3>Eve — Kodowa, Inc.</h3>
				<p>I am currently part of a 4-person Engineering team building Eve, a new programming language based on Datalog and Functional Reactive Programming.

				<h3>Perpetual Autonomous Flight in UAVs — Lehigh University</h3>
				<p>Dynamic soaring is a technique whereby horizontal wind that varies in strength or direction is used to support flight. Seabirds like albatrosses are known to travel hundreds of kilometers in a single day utilizing dynamic soaring. We are investigating the possibility of using dynamic soaring techniques and solar power to generate perpetual flight of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the jet stream. My role in the project includes: systems integration between the aircraft, autopilot, and on-board computer; software integration between wind mapper, local planner, global planner, and hardware; optimal trajectory generation; and motion planning.</p>

				<div class="date">January 2011 - January 2015</div>
				<h3>Smart Wheelchair System — Lehigh University</h3>
				<p>The autonomous wheelchair project is an effort to create a robust robotic wheelchair capable of navigating outdoor urban environments. My role in the project is to facilitate accurate and reliable localization and navigation. Localization is achieved through a combination of 2D and 3D LIDARs used to track salient features such as light poles and parking meters.</p>

							Dynamic soaring (DS) is an aerobatic maneuver whereby a gliding aircraft harnesses energy from horizontal wind that varies in strength and/or direction to support flight. Typical approaches to dynamic soaring in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) use nonlinear optimizers to generate energy-gaining trajectories, which are then followed using traditional controllers. The effectiveness of such a strategy is limited by both the local optimality of the generated trajectory, as well as controller tracking errors. In this paper, we investigate a reinforcement learning (RL) approach working in continuous space to control a DS aircraft flying in shear wind conditions. The RL controller operates in two stages: In the first stage, it observes a traditional sample-based controller flying a locally optimal DS trajectory generated a priori. In the second stage, the sample-based controller is removed and authority is passed to the RL algorithm. We show that by deviating from the original planned trajectory, the RL controller is able to achieve better performance than its baseline teacher controller.

								This paper examines closed-loop dynamic soaring by small autonomous aircraft. Windfield estimation, trajectory planning, and path-following control are integrated into a system to enable dynamic soaring. The control architecture is described, performance of components of the architecture is assessed in Monte Carlo simulation, and the trajectory constraints imposed by existing hardware are described. Hardware in the loop simulation using a Piccolo SL autopilot module are used to examine the feasibility of dynamic soaring in the shear layer behind a ridge, and the limitations of the system are described. Results show that even with imperfect path following dynamic soaring is possible with currently existing hardware. The e
ect of turbulence is assessed through the addition of Dryden turbulence in the simulation environment.

In this paper, we demonstrate reliable navigation of a smart wheelchair system (SWS) in an urban environment. Urban environments present unique challenges for service robots. They require localization accuracy at the sidewalk level, but compromise GPS position estimates through significant multi-path effects. However, they are also rich in landmarks that can be leveraged by feature-based localization approaches. To this end, our SWS employed a map-based localization approach. A map of the environment was acquired using a server vehicle, synthesized a priori, and made accessible to the SWS. The map embedded not only the locations of landmarks, but also semantic data delineating 7 different landmark classes to facilitate robust data association. Landmark segmentation and tracking by the SWS was then accomplished using both 2D and 3D LIDAR systems. The resulting localization method has demonstrated decimeter level positioning accuracy in a global coordinate frame. The localization package was integrated into a ROS framework with a sample based motion planner and control loop running at 5 Hz to enable autonomous navigation. For validation, the SWS repeatedly navigated autonomously between Lehigh University —s Packard Laboratory and the University bookstore, a distance of approximately 1.0 km roundtrip.

							The potential for a gliding UAV to sustain flight by dynamically soaring in a hurricane is investigated. Leveraging extensive storm observations, the wind profile of the hurricane eye is modeled as a continuous function that is zero at the center and increases as a power of the radius. We then derive the equations of motion for a UAV flying in this wind field, and prove analytically that if the wind field exponent n = 1, dynamic soaring is not possible. This analytical result is also validated in simulation. We also provide extensive simulation results for the case where the wind field exponent n &gt; 1. These results indicate that dynamic soaring is in fact possible for such storms, and the velocity gain for a single dynamic soaring cycle is correlated with the wind field gradient.

							A method for distributed parameter estimation of a previously unknown wind field is described. The application is dynamic soaring for small unmanned air vehicles, which severely constrains available computing while simultaneously requiring updates that are fast compared with a typical dynamic soaring cycle. A polynomial parameterization of the wind field is used, allowing implementation of a linear Kalman filter for parameter estimation. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show the effectiveness of the approach. In addition, in-flight measurements of wind speeds are compared with data obtained from video tracking of balloon launches to assess the accuracy of wind field estimates obtained using commercial autopilot modules.

							In this paper, we present the development of a low-cost, high-performance mobile robot platform for educational and research use called RoSCAR. The platform is based on a 1/10-scale short track race car, integrated with an on-board desktop-class computer, odometry, and RGB-D sensing. As part of an experimental robotics course, three student teams used RoSCAR to compete in a race around a 200 m indoor track. Students demonstrated reliable lane tracking and attained average lap speeds of up to 5.7 m/s (equivalent to 202 km/h at full scale). We are currently investigating the viability of a regional robotics competition centered around this concept.

							In this paper we investigate the potential for enhancing the perception capabilities of smart wheelchair systems (SWS) in an urban environment through intensity-based terrain classification. A 3D camera system was employed that provided both range and intensity (remission) measurements to objects in the scene. Each sensor measurement was represented by a feature vector consisting of range, bearing angle, and intensity values. We then constructed a stochastic model by discretizing the feature space into cells, each of which corresponded to a probability mass function (PMF) denoting the probability a point in the feature space belonged to one of four classes: grass, sidewalk, street (blacktop), or unknown. The stochastic model was generated a priori from literally millions of labeled point measurements of the different terrain classes. Bayesian filtering techniques were then used to make a terrain class assignment for ground plane cells in the local map over time. We illustrate the utility of the approach by demonstrating autonomous sidewalk following of the SWS over two hundred of meters solely through terrain class assignment. Extensions such as enhanced ground plane segmentation are also discussed.
